The sun is shining bright today. Birds are singing in the trees. The wind is soft, and the sky is clear. It is a good day to go outside and take a walk. I feel happy and full of energy. Let us enjoy the beauty of this day.


A little cat sat by the window. It watched the rain fall from the sky. The cat liked to stay warm and dry inside the house. After a while, the rain stopped, and the sun came out. The cat jumped with joy and ran outside to play


I wake up early in the morning. I brush my teeth and wash my face. Then, I eat a healthy breakfast with fruits and milk. After that, I get ready for my day. I go out with a smile and try to do my best in everything.
